I have interests in laboratory work, scientific discovery and communication, healthcare, cell biology, genetics, ecology, evolution, physiology, disease, and birds. I have had 6 years of field experience in species identification and species data management for school groups and a wildlife sanctuary, as well as 2.5 years of hands-on laboratory research experience. I have had two different laboratory research positions so far at UMass and an internship at Tessera Therapeutics focused on assay development in gene editing technology.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
